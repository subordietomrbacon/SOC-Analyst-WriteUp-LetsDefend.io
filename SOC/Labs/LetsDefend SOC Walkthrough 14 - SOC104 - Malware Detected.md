3. I started my investigation with my playbook

 ![alt text](../Assets/14SOC104/3.png)

* I know this is Unknown or unexpected outgoing internet traffic, but let's also verify with a tool and skill every SOC analyst should have in their arsenal, GOOGLE(googling)
* Other options do indicate a threat at early stages, but do not indicate data exfiltration from the endpoint, which is the most suspicious thing to identify, and is serious.

so select Unknown or unexpected outgoing internet traffic and hit NEXT Button.


4. lets check if the malware is quarantined/cleaned.

![alt text](../Assets/14SOC104/5.png)

* So I check endpoint security first

![alt text](../Assets/14SOC104/6.png)

The endpoint definitely accessed the service

* So then, next was the Log data

So I checked each log, but nothing on the GoogleUpdate.exe
But the endpoint accessed it, so it must not have been quarantined. Next

5. now lets Analyze Malware in 3rd party tools and find C2 address to check if its malicious file or not 

lets check the file using virustotal tool
