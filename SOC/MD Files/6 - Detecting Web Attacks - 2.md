# LECTURE6: Detecting Web Attacks - 2
## 1) Detecting Open Redirection Attacks

```
What is Open Redirection?

Open redirection is a web security vulnerability that occurs when a website or web application redirects users
to a different URL without proper validation or sanitization of the target URL. Attackers can 
exploit Open Redirection to trick users into visiting malicious websites or performing actions unintended by the website owner.

In an open redirection attack, an attacker typically crafts a legitimate URL hosted on the vulnerable website, 
but includes a malicious URL as a parameter or query string. When a user clicks on the crafted URL, the website's 
redirect mechanism automatically redirects the user to the malicious URL, which can lead to various malicious activities, 
such as phishing attacks, spreading malware, or stealing sensitive information.

Open redirection vulnerabilities commonly occur when websites use user-supplied input, such as URLs, as part of their 
redirect mechanism without proper validation or sanitization. To prevent open redirection attacks, web developers should 
validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used in redirections, and ensure that only trusted and whitelisted URLs 
are allowed for redirection. Additionally, it's important to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms 
to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can perform redirects. Regular security testing, including 
vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, can also help identify and fix open redirection vulnerabilities in web 
applications.
```

Open Redirection Types:
* URL-based open redirection: This is the most common type of open redirection
vulnerability. It occurs when a website takes a URL or a URL parameter as input 
and uses it in a redirect without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker 
can craft a malicious URL that includes a different domain or malicious URL as 
a parameter which will be included in the redirect, leading to an unintended 
redirection to a malicious website.
* JavaScript-based open redirection: This type of open redirection vulnerability 
occurs when a website uses JavaScript to perform a redirect .
* Meta refresh-based open redirection: This type of open redirection vulnerability 
occurs when a website uses the HTML "meta refresh" tag to redirect users to another 
URL automatically .
* Header-based open redirection: This type of open redirection vulnerability 
occurs when a website uses HTTP headers, such as "Location" header, to perform a 
redirect .
* Parameter-based open redirection: This type of open redirection vulnerability 
occurs when a website uses a parameter in the URL or in a form submission as part 
of the redirect process.

```
to Prevention Methods for Open Redirection : 

-Validate and sanitize input
-Use a whitelist approach NOT A BLACKLIST!
-Avoid using user-controlled data in redirects
-Implement proper authorization and authentication
-Implement proper authorization and authentication

Detecting Open Redirect Attacks
What was described in Part 1 was a list of things to do from the perspective of a hacker/attacker. At the 
same time, the issues that a developer should pay attention to while developing were also mentioned.

So in this part, let’s have a look at how to detect Open Redirection attacks with an example. But, before 
moving, let’s quickly recap some of the important things to detect Open Redirection attacks;

If there is a consecutive requests to query string parameters such as ?next (http://website.com/param.php?next=), 
or ?url ( http://website.com/…?url=), with payloads like http://attacker.com or attacker.com (URL structure)
For the WAF or other middleware products, sometimes payloads can have bypass techniques like;

* Localhost
http://[::]:25/
http://①②⑦.⓪.⓪.⓪

* CDIR
http://127.0.0.0

* Decimal Bypass
http://2130706433/ = http://127.0.0.1

* Hexadecimal Bypass
http://0x7f000001/ = http://127.0.0.1

* Encoded characters like %2f = /
Of course it’s not possible to detect or analyze web server logs without using automated detection methods. 
For an easier way, any SOC analyst can use the following regex to detect open redirection attacks. 

/^.*"GET.*\?.*=(https%3a%2f%2f[a-z0-9-]+%2e[a-z]{2,}).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm

This regex will match any log entry where the HTTP method is GET, the request contains a query parameter 
with https://x.com, and the request is using HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1. This should match the most common open 
redirection attack patterns.

You can customize this regex to match specific query parameters or HTTP methods that are relevant to your 
web application. Remember that this regex is just one part of an overall security monitoring strategy and 
should be used in conjunction with other security tools and best practices.

## 2) Detecting Directory Traversal Attacks 

```
What is Directory Traversal?
Directory traversal is an attack type that the attackers leverage often to access files and directories
 that are stored outside the web server's root directory. It involves manipulating input to be able to 
 access files on a web server that are actually not intended to be accessible by unauthorized users. 
 This type of attack is also known as the "dot-dot-slash" attack, and it can be used to gain unauthorized 
 access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on a web server.

For example, let's say a web application uses the following URL to display user profile pictures:

http://example.com/profiles/picture.php?name=user1.jpg

An attacker can leverage directory traversal attack to access files outside of the intended directory 
by adding ../ to the URL. For instance, they could use the following URL to access a file outside of 
the profiles directory: http://example.com/profiles/picture.php?name=../../etc/passwd

This would give the attacker access to sensitive system files, such as the password file.

Actually, at first look, it’s pretty similar to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. The main difference 
between the directory traversal and LFI is the source of the input. Directory traversal involves in manipulating 
the input that is used to access files on a web server, whereas LFI involves in manipulating input that is used 
to include local files within a web application.

In a local file inclusion vulnerability, an attacker can use user input to include a file from the local file 
system into the web application. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server to access the sensitive data.

For example, consider a web application that includes a file based on user input, such as include($_GET['page']). 
An attacker could manipulate the page parameter to include a sensitive file on the server, such as ../../../../etc/passwd. 
This would allow the attacker to read the password file and gain unauthorized access to the system.

In contrast, directory traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files outside of the web application's root directory. 
This can also allow them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data, but the attack vector is different.

```

Directory Traversal Possible Vectors :
* User input
* Cookies
* HTTP headers
* File upload
* Direct requests
* URL manipulation
* Malicious links


to Prevention Methods for Directory Traversal Attacks :
* Input validation and sanitization
* Access controls
* Relative file paths
* Whitelisting
* Web application firewall


### lab

Here is the basic example for detecting these payloads on nginx access.log file;
* /^.*"GET.*\?.*=(%2e%2e%2f).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm

Basic regex that we have shared above will work with these logs but to prevent False Positive alarms it can be updated more strictly like;
* /^.*"GET.*\?.*=(.+?(?=%2e%2e%2fetc%2f)).+?.*HTTP\/.*".*$/gm



These are detection payloads for the Directory Traversal attack. For a successful exploit, 
attacker needs to access some files. most popular ones are;
- Linux

1. /etc/issue
2. /etc/passwd
3. /etc/shadow
4. /etc/group
5. /etc/hosts

- Windows

1. c:/boot.ini
2. c:/inetpub/logs/logfiles
3. c:/inetpub/wwwroot/global.asa
4. c:/inetpub/wwwroot/index.asp
5. c:/inetpub/wwwroot/web.config
6. c:/sysprep.inf



### Lets Solve it!
1. Go to Log location: /root/Desktop/QuestionFiles/Directory-Traversal/access.log
 with CTRL + F search for payload , hear i searched “passwd” which common payload for 
 directory traversal for linux so the line 215 th looks malicious.

## 3) Detecting Brute Force Attacks

```
What is Brute Forcing?
Brute forcing is a type of attack that involves attempting to guess a password or authentication token by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. In the context of web attacks, brute forcing typically refers to the process of using automated tools to repeatedly submit login requests to a web application using different username and password combinations until a valid one is discovered.

Brute force attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system, steal sensitive information, or launch further attacks against the target or other systems. They can be particularly effective against weak or poorly protected passwords, but can also be very time-consuming and resource-intensive for the attacker, especially if the target system has implemented measures to detect and block brute force attacks.

Brute force attacks are one of the simplest and most straightforward methods of attacking a web application, and it works by systematically trying every possible combination of usernames and passwords until the correct one is found. This process is typically automated using specialized software or scripts, which can try thousands or even millions of combinations per second.

The basic idea behind a brute force attack is to exploit the weak or easily guessable passwords that a lot of people use especially the non-techy users, such as common dictionary words, simple number sequences, or their own names or birthdates. By systematically trying every possible combination of characters, attackers can eventually find the correct password and gain access to the target system.
