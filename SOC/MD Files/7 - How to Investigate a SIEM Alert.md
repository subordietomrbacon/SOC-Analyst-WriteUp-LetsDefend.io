# LECTURE7: How to Investigate a SIEM Alert?
## 1) Introduction to SIEM Alerts
>**ANSWER: CHECK**

## 2) Detection

### SIEM alerts:  
are notifications generated by the SIEM system based on predefined rules 
and correlation algorithms. These rules are typically customized to meet an organization's 
specific security requirements. When an event matches the defined criteria, the SIEM 
system triggers an alert.

### Playbooks: 
There are many different types of alerts (web attacks, ransomware, malware, phishing, etc.) 
in the SOC (Security Operations Centre) environment. The methods and approaches for 
investigating these alerts are different. Workflows for effective and consistent analysis of 
alerts generated by SIEM or other security tools are called playbooks.

### Why Are Playbooks Important?
As SOC analysts, we don't always know the exact steps to take when dealing with alerts. 
Playbooks help by providing a clear, step-by-step process to follow 
during an investigation. This is especially helpful for new analysts just starting their SOC careers.

### Alerts Types:
 * A true positive means that the alert is legitimate and requires further action,  
 * false positive means that the alert is a false alarm.

#### In which channel can you take ownership of the alert?
 >**ANSWER: main channel**
  #### Once you have completed the analysis of an alert, in which channel can you close the alert?
 >**ANSWER: Investigation channel**

## 3) Case Creation and Playbook Initiation

 Creating a case allows us to organize and track our investigation efforts, 
 while the playbook guides us through the necessary steps to effectively respond to the security incident.

### lets solve this chapter lab EventID: 257 - SOC282 - Phishing Alert - Deceptive Mail Detected 
 
1. Clicking on the "Take Ownership" button

![alt text](../Assets/lab7/2.png)
As we can see, there is a phishing email alert. Let’s check it more closely.




2. Keep the playbook in a new tab because it shows us the steps to solve this lab 

![alt text](../Assets/lab7/3.png)

we should answer the playbook Questions 
* When was it sent?
* What is the email's SMTP address?
* What is the sender address?
* What is the recipient address?
* Is the mail content suspicious?
* Are there any attachment?




3. in the alert we have the SMTP Address 

![alt text](../Assets/lab7/1.png)
its 103.80.134.63




4. Now we enter the Email Security section from the left sidebar to check the email content 

![alt text](../Assets/lab7/4.png)
![alt text](../Assets/lab7/5.png)
Now we have the date the email was received and the content of the email.
It includes an attached file, along with the sender and recipient addresses.





5. Now let’s check if the attached file is malicious or not

We download it (the password is "infected").

![alt text](../Assets/lab7/6.png)
After extracting it, Windows Defender shows that it is a malicious file.


![alt text](../Assets/lab7/7.png)
It says the file is a backdoor virus.


![alt text](../Assets/lab7/9.png)
If we upload the file (RECOMMENDED) to [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) it shows that it is 
malicious software classified as a trojan.




6. Now we have all the information we need. Let’s start closing the alert

7. Let’s delete the email from the customer’s mailbox

9. Go to the "EDR" page and contain the user’s machine

![alt text](../Assets/lab7/16.png)
Go to the EDR page and contain the user’s machine by searching for the victim’s address 172.16.20.3.
